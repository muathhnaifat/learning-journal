## Git   

*Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. Now thatâ€™s a lot of words to define Git.*

Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.
Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code. and sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.

Finally we should go by order :
+ Add
+ commit
+ push
