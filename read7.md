# Script

A script or scripting language is a computer language with a series of commands within a file that is capable of being executed without being compiled.

Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step .
A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page .

Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them .


# JavaScript Functions 

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).


## JavaScript Function Syntax :
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

## Function Invocation :

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)
You will learn a lot more about function invocation later in this tutorial.


# Expressions 

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. 
- A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator .
- A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:

# operators 

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically .
