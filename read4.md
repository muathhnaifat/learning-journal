## HTML Layout Elements

Websites often display content in multiple columns .
HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section


The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.


## Article

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

## Why Do You Need A Target Audience?
 great marketing begins and ends with the audience. But if you want great conversion, it begins and ends with marketing to the right audience.

Focusing your website’s message, advertising promotions, and content to your identified audience filters out unnecessary traffic and entices high potential leads.

Marketing effort optimizations can be done only if you know your audience. Learn what makes them tick, what you can do to persuade them, how to get their acceptance, and most importantly, how they’ll choose you.

## Who is Your Target Audience?
Your target audiences are the predetermined recipients of your all marketing efforts. They are the intended group whom you want to reach and convert into paying customers.

Most businessmen and marketers are blind to their real target audience. Most of them say, ‘People who want to buy my merch’,  ‘Everyone’, ‘Males’, “Women.”

If you answer the same, this might cause your business peril.

You can identify your target audience by asking these questions: Who are they? What’s their demographic (age, education level, profession, location)? What’s their most pressing issue, problem, or desire? How does your product solve their problem?
