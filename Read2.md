## text editor 
 
 A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.
The text editor a personal choise , because when you use each of them , you can't say that I've found an a bsolute favorite one.
And I think the best text editor is truly the one that you enjoy using the most .

 the great feature of any text editing software is code completion , and another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently and one more feature is Syntax highlighting that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text .

Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.” .
And if you want to try using the text editors that come with your computer, there’s a couple of caveats that I’d like to make you aware
of : 

1.make sure that you’re creating code in a plain text editor. You should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic.
Plain text has no formatting options .

2.make sure that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere (maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website.

3.make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names .
