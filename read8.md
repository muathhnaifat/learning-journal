A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

## Processing
The system unit is the core of a computer system and the main processing center. Usually it's a rectangular box that holds many electronic components that process information. The most important part of these components is the central processing unit (CPU) also called the processor. The CPU is the brain of your computer it is the key component in interpreting computer program instructions and processes data.  The next most critical element of a processing is RAM, often referred to as "primary storage" or "main memory". Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on and is erased when the computer is turned off.
 
## Storage
Computers usually have one or more disk drives, commonly referred to as a hard drive—devices that store information. The disk preserves the information even when your computer is turned off. All computers have a hard disk drive that can hold massive amounts of information; they usually serve as your computer's primary means of storage, holding almost all of your programs and files. The hard disk drive is normally located inside the system unit.
