__Welcome to my page__

I'm Muath AL-Hnaifat , and I wat to talk about growth mindset .


***growth mindset***

students believe their abilities and intelligence can be developed with effort, learning, and persistence. Their basic abilities are simply a starting point for their potential. They don't believe everyone is the same, but they hold onto the idea that everyone can become smarter if they try.


I alawys remind my self :

1- Remember that it takes time to learn

2- Never stop learning. Set a new goal for every one you accomplished.

3- Learn from the mistakes of others.
